## a few notes about .gitignore
- files names are still public just fyi in case there's some sensitive info
- if you've already commited the file but no longer want to share it, then you'll have to delete the file from the web browser becuase you've already committed it. there's better workarounds,but this might be the easiest.

- could also ignore files:

Go to git pane (the tab that says Git),
Right click on .Rhistory and select Ignore...
Check if the content of .gitignore is correctly updated and click Save.
